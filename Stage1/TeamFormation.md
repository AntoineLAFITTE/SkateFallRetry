# Team Formation

## Introduction

As a beginner in web development, I have already completed 3 group projects: an UberEats clone and a web app to recognize animals from photos to add them to your collection and an AirBnB Basic clone.
These experiences have gave me a foundational understanding of collaboration and web application design.

For this solo project, I will adapt team formation practices to structure my workflow, planning, and communication.

## Initial Planning :

Background and Strengths

While working on the UberEats clone, Hbnb Clone and the animal recognition app, I developed skills in:

**Frontend Development**: Building user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript also desiging with figma.

**Collaboration Tools**: Using Git, GitHub, and project management tools like Trello.

**Problem-Solving**: Debugging and improving application functionality.

These skills will help me go through this project, even though I will also focus on expanding my knowledge of more advanced web development concepts.

## Setting a Structure :

Since im alone on this project, I will play multiple roles :

**Project Manager**: Planning the project timeline and landmarks.

**Developer**: Coding and debugging the code for the project.

**Tester**: Making sure of functionalities working corectly.

## Establishing Norms :

## Communication

**Tools**: I will use Notion to document ideas, progress, and blockers.

**Frequency**: Provide weekly updates in a progress journal.

**Collaboration and Decision-Making**

Since im solo on this project:

For decision-making, I will evaluate options by considering its complexity and alignment with project goals.

## Tools for Project Management :

**Task Management**: Trello to track tasks and deadlines.

**Version Control**: Git and GitHub for maintaining code versions.

**Documentation**: Markdown files for project documentation, README with technical explanations.

**Initial Roles**:

**Project Manager**: Responsible for planning the initial stages of the project, breaking down the tasks, and managing the timeline.

**Developer**: Creating the necessary code and ensuring the project meets requirements.
