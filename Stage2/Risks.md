| **Lack of experience with certain technologies (ex, video hosting)**     | Follow a Tutorial or beginner-friendly tools like Cloudinary for the video storage.                          |
| **Difficulty organizing time as a solo developer**                       | Break tasks into small points, create a realistic timeline, and use tools like Trello to track the progress. |
| **Potential bugs or issues with a functionality**                        | Test each feature after implementation and consider using a testing framework (Jest, Pytest....).            |
| **Over-scoping the project**                                             | Define Clearly MVP deliverables, focus on core functionalities before considering additional features.       |
| **Security vulnerabilities in the user authentication**                  | Use already established libraries (Flask-Login or Django authentication) to follow security best practices.  |
| **Unclear or shifting project goals**                                    | Document the scope and objectives clearly and revisit them to keep track without loosing the main goals.     |
